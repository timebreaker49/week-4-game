This is a simple click-based (one-button) RPG that utilizes jQuery

Background:
In week 4 of the program, we were given an assignment to make a basic game. Among a given set of characters, you choose a character and an enemy to battle against. Each of the characters has similar stats and there is no health regeneration. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy characters. With each attack, your character's attack is stacked with their default attack power (for instatnce, if base attack is 5, then each time they attack, they gain 5 additional attack power). This is so that a character can have the ability to defeat multiple enemies without regenerating health. 

I chose Kingdom Hearts for my theme!
Please enjoy!
